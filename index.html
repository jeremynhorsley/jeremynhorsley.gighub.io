    <h2>How do I get started with windsurfing?</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Take a beginner lesson from a certified school. Windsurfing is pretty technical and is MUCH EASIER to learn with a lesson from a certified school. Within a 2 day beginner lesson, you will be sailing (windsurfing) around and turning.</li>
    <li>Practice. Windsurfing is easy to learn but takes time to get really good. The more time you spend on the water, the faster you will improve. We rent gear for all ability levels so you can come back and practice after your lesson.</li>
    <li>Buy Gear. Once you have passed the beginner windsurfing phase and are learning to use a harness and waterstart, you are ready to get intermediate gear. All windsurfing students taking our 2 day class receive a $200 discount on a complete windsurfing gear package. See our gear page for more details.</li>

    <h2>How does windsurfing work?</h2>
    <p>Windsurfing was invented in the 1960s by 2 California guys – a sailor and a surfer. They decided to try putting
a sail on a surf board, and a new sport was born. The sport has come a long way, and now is easier than ever to pick up. The boards have become wide and stable, the sails light and easy to manage. Windsurfing uses the same engineering principals as flying and sailing. The sail acts as a foil, and the wind creates “lift” in the sail that makes you glide along the water. You learn to sheet in (bring the sail in closer to you by pulling in with your back hand) to increase power. You learn to sheet out (let the sail out away from you by letting out your back hand) to decrease power. With alternate hand movements, you control the angle of the sail to the wind. The more wind in the sail, the faster you go. Turning is accomplished by leaning the sail back towards the back of the board (go upwind) or leaning the sail towards the front of the board (go downwind).</p>
